    <h1>Welcome to Learn to Code!</h1>
    <p>Here you'll learn the basics of programming, web development, and more. Coding is a very difficult art that could take you months, or even years to master! But, don't fret! I'm here to help you with any code-related learning you need to endure!</p>
    
    <h2>Today's Lesson: Understanding Slopes</h2>
    <p>Curious about how slopes work in mathematics? Click the button below to see an interactive example!</p>
    
    <button class="button" onclick="showGame()">How Do Slopes Work?</button>

    If you don't know what slopes are, I'll explain below! Slopes are a constant downward line used in functions. Have you ever been riding a bike down a road? Well, you were actually riding down a slope! Slopes are the fundamental of game programming, and are very important when it comes to it. Click below for the next page!
