Year 0:

some notes: Elestiyanj is Zelfen, AlexGrozniy is CROK, kkidslogin is Tal'dorei/TE, abcde26 is Pesten, Pixelation-Creations is The Balkan Republic/BR, the Kalonip Industries is SnabianStudios, Tanerdamian is ScratchCatHELLO, Amtabol Company is KefonOverHere, PRND is ToastersUnited, Armasth is Trainboy456, Rukari is TrianglePanBrain

   Temporary Peace
______________________

CROK becomes neutral

Kigou Onbáng announces the free business act of Elestiyanj, which puts trust into Elestiyanjis and allows them to make and run companies without extreme government surveillance. Many foreigners think this will be a first step in freedom in Elestiyanj

The TE prepares a large army as fears of an alliance war mounts.

Pesten builds a HUGE army as it is scared since many people are against it's new act.

Elestiyanj starts using propaganda to recruit people into its army, we also say that we will not attack anyone unless Elestiyanj or a GDU member is attacked first.

Kalonip Industries introduces himself as the first company we benefit nations Powder(gun powder company) and much more we will make frigates muskets and much more you should buy at us.

Skelmrelm produces 10000 muskets, 2000 pistols, 20000 sabers and 30 cannons. The cost is 140 tons timber, 470 tons metal and 2400 k nocks.

Kalonip industries relationship with many countries we ask all countries if we can make our building there to make our influence go worldwide we will pay 500K nocks

From the technology project: "Elestiyanj build 510,000 muskets for our military for 5100 timber, 5100 metal, and 35,700,000 nocks. We then build 200,000 sabers for 3000 metal and 7,000,000 nocks. We stop military related investments from there for a while"

Elestiyanj begin to train new military units. We use some unused land nearby Sarakshél as a training area

The Balkan Republic increases army wages to GBX300/person (GBX stands for G'ivol Brihschact Xeriv, or Intranational Balkan Currency). 1 GBX = 1.1nock. The army wages increased prompt many able-bodied homeless/poor people to join the army, as well as many middle-class, and our army size rises to 900,000 active, with another 102,000 reserves.

The Balkan Republic modify the MOW to incorporate a catamaran design, reducing costs, increasing efficiency, but also lowering power, but increasing speed. 12 of these are built for 3kt metal, 6kt timber, and 600ton canvas, canvas is gotten from our farms, same with timber.

The Kalonip industries makes a Safehouse for the President and the Chairman in Tal'dorese and in Elestiyanj and Skemrelm paying them all 2M nocks

Tanerdamian commends Pesten for their law supporting human rights.

Tanerdamian seeks to purchase metal in exchange for wood or fish.

(Balkan Republic) 1,000 cannons are consstructed for 2k metal, 1k wood, as well a single water mill, but since our population is largely fish-eating, with small amounts of rice, other seafood, we do not need many. Oh and 5,000 sabers, which are forged in katana style and hardened with titanium and other strong metals.

selling 490K muskets buy now from the Kalonip industries

(Balkan Republic) We ramp up fish production, in peactime using our catamarans as fishing boats and sinking money into local fishing companies. We also begin salt production for 50,000 nocks and begin building military bases, 3 in Sarajevo, a Naval station by Athenia, one near PRND, one on the herbana island w0ith T4, and one on the south near Spartae, another near southport, as well as erecting defense lines near PRND

The spheres of influence of the Kalonip Industries are Balkan federation, Elestiyanj Stermrelm, Tal'dorese, Tanerdamian republic,Herbanal republic hooray im the progressing nation

(CROK) We are sailing to pestan on new brand new ships. 2 ships are sailing to pesten to coungrats them for joining gdu. Alao on 1 of ship there is a small ortchestra that plays anthem of crok

(Pesten) I officially send 2 ships to CroK including 10k wood, 5k food and 100 muskets.

(Kalonip Industries) anyone pls trade me for 10 sailing ships for 200 muskets

(Tal'dorei) I'm looking to start a trade deal for food gathering. In total, I need about 130K tons of food, but I can have multiple people in this deal. If you have wood, you can help too: https://ccrpiv.miraheze.org/wiki/Resource_Deposits . I have mostly BM up for grabs, but I could offer some nocks as well.

(Pesten) CCRP IV is about to get it's first ever athletic games event, THE OLYMPICS! Join for the Normani Olympics which starts in 31st July, 2:00 PM UTC for the games. Since this is the first one, all countries have to make a team by filling this forum: Country Name: _ No. of Athletes: _ Team Captain (name): _

Tanerdamian is currently looking for food, building materials, and fuel.

(Kalonip Industries) anyone wanna trade for 200 muskets for 10 sailing ships i'll pay nocks like 50K nocks

(Kalonip Industries) WOOHOOO i send 10 sailing ships to find land but they are made with 25K timber because i want them fast and nice to sail to find land so IM THE FIRST PERSON TO TRY TO EXPLORE THE WORLD

(Kalonip Industries) HELLO SELLING 410k MUSKETS PLEASE BUY

(Kalonip Industries) Hello if you are willing to buy from me go to this link or to know what im selling or what's my stock Here's the link everyone https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/715777897 you better buy now before it goes offsale

The Amtabol company officially established. Centers of Gambling/Lottery will be opened soon

Citizens of GDU countries are allowed enter PRND without a valid visa as long as they bring a passport, validation check, health check and gdu validation reciept to the border.

Citizens of the SIA And tamerdamian rep, can enter BR cities with a proof of ID, and a proof of citizenship in SIA/TR. they need nothing else and can move freely within BR and access countries the BR has deals with (none at the moment)

Elestiyanj outlaws gambling

CRoK outlaws gambling

Herbana limits gambling, with only 3 Gambling centers in major cities, which are heavily Surveyed by the Council.

(Ambatol Company) Ok, everyone is just gossiping about my single gambling thing. I removed gambling from the list and only let lotteries slip. If more complications "emerge their ugly heads from the bushes," I'd move on to seperatist movements. If all doesn't work, Id just scan the map until i find a country that looks unstable and then put up rebellion

Pesten bans lottery tickets over 100k nocks. (sorry kefon. need to do my contribution as the richer will get richer and poorer will get poorer if they are over 100k nocks. i think.)

We send 3 of our ships to explore 1,500 miles to the south. if nothign will be found we will go back. if somethign happens to ships there are things to do: pick up crew os sinking ship. countiniu goin.

Citizens of GDU countries can travel into the TE without a visa so long as they have a legal ID identifying them as citizens of a GDU country. Also, the TE makes gambling with odds worse than 1/1000 and prizes more than 12,000 Nocks illegal. In addition, there is a 7% tax put on the gambling company for all legal sells. Putting the tax on customers is illegal.

(CROK) on our 3 ships we put 500 people and 50 tons of food for them to survive. goodluck, explorers of the great republic!

(BR, in response to CROK) 1 Man-o-war pursues your ships, catching up as your ships use about half of their food and provide food to your ships, and fishing nets, and join up with them

Tanerdamian is currently looking for food, building materials, fuel, and canvas.

Crok is developing a new laguange! Caik En Gag

(Elestiyanj) https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/716058055/ - we do an expedition, anyway the ship is one of those prebuilt ones you start with, we load our ship with 30 men and 30 tons of food or however much they need

(Kalonip) Ehrmmm we'll pay 500K nocks for a country to let us build our building there to increase our spheres of influence and we would likely want to trade for food

     Start of Hostile Relations
____________________________________

(Tal'dorei) I begin fishing the F2 deposit by the Balkan Republic. I don't care if they attack me for it as I'm running out of food.

(Tal'dorei) I dispute the ownership of the F2 deposit by the Balkan Republic.

(BR, in response to Tal'dorei) I send 4,100 men and 3 man o war to defend our deposit as we largely rely on fish for food

(Pesten) THE OLYMPICS IS ABOUT TO BEGIN! I need every single country in the world to reply to this comment to participate in the Olympics. Any reply counts as a yes.

the Tanerdamian Republic builds 40 looms, 39,000 muskets, 41,000 pistols, and 1,000 sabers. the Tanerdamian Republic is still looking for fuel.

(Ambatol) Expedition is still continuing while plans for country establishment when land is reached are being shaped

      The First War
___________________________

(Tal'dorei) I declare war on the Balkan Republic.

Elestiyanj provides Tal'dorese soldiers with food and fuel

(Tal'dorei) Invasion plan: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/716280973/

Tanerdamian trains 80,000 soldiers and builds 3 sailing ships along with two men of war.

(CROK) We ask balkan republic to not remove our political ties and countiniu our relation as CroK is a neutral coutnry and wants a good relation with every one. we are not choosign a side, we just stay neutral.

by a slim margin, Tanerdamian announces support for the Balkan Republic against the Empire, but due to heavy isolationist sentiment in the country, it’s unlikely that the Republic will become involved.

(Kalonip) We ask all GDU nations to not attack any building that The Kalonip Industries made we are neutral in this war you could either go to my marketplace to buy muskets it doesnt matter i dont have political sides and we want good relations with the GDU AND THE SIA we do not want our company to be involved in this war thank you

Pesten help Tal'dorese empire by sending 10k troops.

Skelmrelm produces 3 men of war and 70K muskets for 2200T metal, 3700T timber, 150T canvas and 900 M nocks

The Balkan rep signs in Overlord, which allows the military to control the government during war by a vote if 72.1%. We draft up till 2.4 mil soldiers and arm them. We counter the naval invasion off h shallow waters of Athenia with cannons and trick th men o war into sandbars, where our men in small fishing boats and the city cannons can destroy them.

(BR) We produce 3 trading ships (catamarans) and are them, they negate with men o war and are much faster but have less arms
last year

(BR) We launch counterattacks on taldorese forces

Merion declares state of emergency constructs 50 wagons, 5 looms, rush builds 50k muskeeters (and 50k pistols), 100 cannons costing 7.5k tonnes of timber, 7.1k tonnes of metal costing 35 million nocks and defenses are being rushed into construction along the towns of Barvia, Ishele, Millesten.

Skelmrelm condemns the Tal'dorese Empire for invading Balkan Republic (which is a SIA member) and moves 150K troops to the border with Tal'dorese Empire.

Elestiyanj announces that they will not engage in the war unless the Balkan Republic attempts an invasion, however, we will help Tal'dorese troops if they ask

Pesten builds 50k muskets and 7 frigates to help TD (Tal'dorese Empire). The IOC also blacklists TD and BR from the Olympics, saying that it will prevent further damage.

(Elestiyanj) We enforce national service, so we can train reserves. All DRE citizens aged 17 must be in the military for 1.5 years. They may avoid service if they are unhealthy

(BR) We publish reports of Taldorese cannon fire hitting villages on the North Peninsula, and that motivates many people to fight harder

Merions refits 5 cannons onto the 5 civilian vessels repurposed for defenses against the Taldorese aggressor and Pesten.

(BR) We deploy the 5th Special Forces, they are our elite commandos and have: 1 katana, 1 musket, 2 pistol. They are nicknamed SKT, standing for Stopv a'Kuman Trop, meaning the Storm Troopers ( i had to.) They know the lay of the land VERY VERY well and use this to destroy enemies easily

(BR) We distribute scopes and improve muskets of our troops. This increases our accuracy a lot as the scopes and rifling on muskets increase accuracy and power

(BR) Heavy cannon fire pushes the Taldorese back, we have taken 12,000 casualties due to our tactical advantages, knowing the land better, and defended positions (walls with cannons are far more effective than just cannons).

(Skelmrelm) We produce 170 cannons and move them to Tal'dorese border (cost = 340T metal, 170T wood, 127M nocks)

(BR message to the Tal'dorese) "look, Taldorese, surrender now, or we will destroy you fully"

(BR) We cut off Tal'dorese supply lines with the East Army and South Army (500,000 + 300,000), and deploy cannons to starve the Taldorese troops

(Merion) 150k troops (50k of them are the professional Merion army with muskets and pistol) support the balkan Republic + 50 cannons and 25 supply wagons

(Skelmrelm) I move 50K more troops to the border

(Tal'dorei) I follow in the BR's footsteps and temporarily allow the military to run things for 2 years or until the war is over, becoming a Military Dictatorship. I draft 350,000 men and supply them with rifles, and hurridly begin making men-of-war. I prepare the Capitol for attack, stationing all 70 of my cannons that remain at the Capitol, and reinforcing the walls before the BR Army arrives.

(Merion) Parliament passes the emergency ship building act 4 man of war are being planned to be constructed and the recently imported Tanerdamian workers will be drafted into the army soon

(Tal'dorei) The new new men-of-war are being constructed, 5 of them. They are being built inland to the BR army cannot reach them without defeating Elestiyanj.

(TE) I bring the two remaining frigates and 3 sailing ship up the Taidun River into the TE for repairs.

the Tanerdamian Republic doubles taxes to ø1,000 because I realized soldiers have to be payed a lot and I wasn't making anywhere near enough from taxes to pay my (tiny) army. keep in mind that this is like the equivalent of a 2% income tax for most people, the lowest tax bracket in America being 10

(TE) I declare that Kalonip Industries is not neutral as they supply the Balkan Republic. Any dealings of Kalonip Industries in the TE is made illegal.

(Armasth) We begin to export tons of Timber, being pretty much our only natural resource.

the Tanerdamian Republic is still looking for fuel.

Truth: The Amtabol foundation has only sent the 2 frigates out west as an expansion plan. Now the Amtabol foundation will build and make buildings, arsenal, etc. Resources will be used from Nobra Disky until the new land is found

Pesten withdrawls their remaining troops from Balkan Republic as a effort to remain as neutral as possible. A revolution is almost here as the state of Tanerdami Isolas wants to break off and join with Tanerdami, causing chaos in Northern Pesten.

The Rukari Federation declares that any nation that supports Taldorese in their war against the Balkan Union will be blockaded.

The Herbanan Republic would announce its neutrality in the recent Tal'dorese-Balkan War.

Ashphelnumentica will be entirely neutral in the Tal'dorese-Balkan war (I mean, not like we could do anything anyways)

Pestenish Rebel Group Sólvista Pestania declares war on the Merion Consortium due to being angry from the TE-BR war. The DRP isn't involved in this war in any way, as we have declared neutrality.

(TE) The Council decides that, as Serv has handled "it" (The war) so poorly, that he will be impeached. While he technically doesn't need to pay attention to them right now, he follows their wishes. A new king, named Phrodo Dom, is elected, and becomes absolute ruler of the Tal'dorese Empire. He wishes to end the war, so he will do the following if the BR and SIA would leave the TE intact: A), he'd pay a 100B nock reparation payment, B), he'd reduce the size of the military to 300,000, and C) he would allow the BR to station troops, build military bases, and move troops through the TE. This would leave the TE weakened but alive.

(Armasth) The Council of Leaders has decided that Armasth will stay neutral in the war.

(BR) Actually, we will accept conditional surrender on these terms: 1) You gift all but 310,000 muskets and pistols (combined) to New Canciona, and the Rukari Federation. 2) You keep a max military of 220,000. 3) Even in alliance wars, we will have a 10 year NAP. 4) You let me have the F2 deposit. 5) I will provide you with food if i can afford it and if you don't have it. 6) You let me maintain military bases inside Tal'dorese.

(BR) We set taxes at 6,120 nocks/citizen/year, the citizens have a chance to vote on the original 7,000, popular vote dropped it to 6,000 but weighted votes increased it to 6,500, and then the population voted for 6,120, and 82.1% agreed.

News: The formerly banned Democratic Syndicism party of the Rukari Federation has joined the central governing Itadkerist party, to the dismay of most of its former members who were against the current dictator Francisco Spainco. So all the other 'illegal' parties get a bit more popular. (if you don't know what I'm talking about it's in the near bottom of the notes and credits part of my country project)

(TE) I'll agree to these terms. And... Sorry... It's Tal'dorei, not Tal'dorese, except in the country name or referring to people in Tal'dorei (Whom are more commonly referred to as Gozians)

   After the First War
___________________________

(TE) We make some changes to Taxes: all people get a 2000 nock tax, the upper 10% get another 3000 nocks on top of that, the top 1% gets another 11,000 nocks on top of that.

(PRND) Ancient tradition says the world will end in 60 years but most have switched to either steriteristism, stanosh or chatolich (they plan on changing calandars soon too)

(PRND) Two things happen in Nobra Disky. The first is that the country now uses Giteravas (~) 100 nock = ~3 (Likely will inflate). The second thing is elekitars disky, this is a big election that happens every 60 years and decides the top government (top government every 60 years, middle every 30 years, lower every 4 years) the top government influences who wins the middle and lower elections while in power by being able to cast 1.1M votes (so in total, since voting is mandatory in PRND the total votes in the elections for lower and middle are 11.1M, 1.1M over the population). Parties are: CPND (currently in power), Republika Diskytarktyo Forum, Elegurv, Walt Wite Party, Mickey D. Hickens Party, Stortaz Communitis Partii, Touleecois Communityies Partie, and Itadkerist ND.

(Merion) A military base is being constructed in Barvia and the Fodder army is dissolved stone forts are being constructed on Ishele and Skovado costing 50 million nocks

Tax in PRND at 22% Income, 03% Commercial, 45% Industrial, general ~70 per person per year, the CPND aren't too fond on taxes (though reap the giant benefits of the industrial tax) whixh many think is an outrage, also people think the government should take more general and commercial tax because of lack of funds.

Merion switches currency to solon, 1 solon = 1000 nocks

2 Things. 1. Pesten switches currency to the Séklemaina. 1 PSM = 5 nocks. 1 nock = 50 chartes (coins). Secondly, The first assembly elections are starting. The 2 parties, The Liberte Party and the Republic Party, are all in competition to who owns the country (the most).

Admin Note (CatMan2197): To all those changing currencies: Before you decide to create your country's own currency, there are multiple negative factors they cause I'd like you to think about. 1: How will players-and admins-be able to quickly convert money from one to another and check balances? 2: How will new players understand economics with a ton of different currencies, unlike Exarchates? 3: Could unannounced or frequent inflation cause mass-confusion about the value of a currency and mess up trading for a time?

To follow along with the trend or something the Rukari Federation announces the Shinyo (credit in Japanese) and sets the official rate to 1 Nock = 1 Shinyo (thereby tying it to the Nock) and we'll also make a project to show currency rates because yes. The currency exchange is out! https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/716587165/

(BR) The GCX value has stabilized at 102.3 nock per GCX. (Gcx is the first non nock currency)

(Elestiyanj) Kigou Onbáng outlaws any form of trade with SIA members and Kalonip Industries

(PRND) The giteravas is at a steady ~0.042 = 1 nock

Tanerdamian is still searching for fuel.

Admin Note (roitwell): Catman and I have come up with a solution for inflation that will likely be put in place, we are going to make you all pay to build houses for your citizens.
last year

(BR) Finished upkeep for this year (early ik), also we are now back to Dem Rep bc war is over and Overlord Prtcl. is only for wartime. We have now 750,000 soldiers, and are beginning scrap processes on Taldorei ships that beached near Athenia, and 240,000 muskets (gifted from Cancioni inutillia), and Taldorei let me know your casualties, by my calculations (of what you said your losses were they are around 72k.), then we scrap those muskets and p1stols too and scrap 50 cannons that were captured as well.

News: Francisco Spainco made a speech in the Rukarian capital today announcing a crackdown on all members and supporters of the direct democracy party, lowering their support among (woah among like the funny game) the populace. 

(In respone to Rukari) Tanerdamian denounces this move as yet another attempt by the Federation to infringe upon the rights of its own citizens.

(PRND) Construction of the Trakkti ND Network has begun with the plans for a railway between Vhreskirhat, Vihily, Relisey and finally, to Sederv. What recources would be needed to acomplish this?(posh language go brrrr)

(TE) I pay various local contractors to build housing for my current populace, building about 5.5 million homes for about 1M nocks each. the other 1.5M homes already existed. Nevermind, I build 5.5 mil homes for 40,000 nocks each, 1M would be like quadrillions of nocks in total. NVM again, more like 2,000 nocks each (they're really more like shacks at this point). UHG IM STILL GOING BANKRUPT fine I build them for 200 nocks each like the CRoK. NVM I FORGOT A BIT OF THE CALCULATION I PAY 1M per home again sorry for pulling a Snabian. Well I actually pay 100,000, and that's final.

Herbana ditched the Nock and makes its own currency, the Herbanan Sħęea (sħ)

(PRND) Our average income has increased. ~66 per week (~3432 per year perperson) commercial tax is ~8000 per year per company, and industrial tax is ~1,100 per year per factory (ifIcan do thus). Thus means I get 34,320,000,000 every year until a company is set up in the PRND or I make factories. Foreign companies that wish to operate in nobra disktly will need to pay commercial tax. We build houses for our people, 7M houses altogether, the next 3M will be completed next year. These houses cost ~11337 each (487.491 nocks) altogether costing us 3,412,437,000 nocks or ~79,359,000,000 gitervas. We are left with 1,996,587,563,000 nocks or ~4,643,226,890,697.7

(NOT important to the history, but cool to see. https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/31228758/comments/#comments-191118272)

Admin Note (CatMan2197): I’m already finding the new currencies to be a nightmare, so I might have some sort of poll on if we should be using so many soon once their impacts are obvious.

(PRND) Construction of the Dysk Canal has begun. It will go from the West Cost to the very east, going through cities like Vihily and Zat. There are also plans to expand it through the whole of Initia (horizontally) though we would need to ask permission to countries. We would pay every country that agrees 50% of money earned from canal tolls in their country. Reply here if you want us to build through you. Preferably if you border me or any country with the canal, but you can apply in advance too.

Tanerdamian is still looking for fuel

After a poll, I am proud to announce the three main political parties of the TE: The Queso party (currently in power), the Sushi party, and the Applebee's Party. More details in the TE project.

Merion will soon privatize its agriculture, fishing, and (soon-to-be) industrial sectors.

finally (on November 21st), Tanerdamian has enough resources to make it through the year.

(Rukari) News: Protests have taken place in the streets of Rukaria following the crackdown on democratic parties. The presidential cabinet has responded and announced that a parliament will be set up to keep the president and dictator Francisco Spainco's power in check. Although many protesters have continued, calling the planned parliament (especially the upper house) a sham designed to keep protesters quiet, most stopped when hearing that elections will be held within a year or so. Upper House: House of Councilors | Lower House: House of Representatives. The House of Councilors will apparently be appointed by the monarch of Rukaria, but as both monarchal houses were exiled after the civil war many decades prior the regent appoints the councilors, however the regent is Francisco Spainco's granddaughter, Caroline Spainco. The House of Representatives will be wholly elected by all land-owning men over the age of 30. Considering that pretty much everyone in the country despises the current government in one way or another if Francisco Spainco's party wins a complete majority then it is a sham, but we shall see if it is or not.

(BR) the President has made a yearly plan submission to the High Council, it will be reviewed by them and revised and then sent to the populace. If they like what it entails(55% majority (+-7% to challenge), the President and HC members stay in office. If not, they are given a chance to revise the plan and if they do not secure a 75% majority among the people (no challenges allowed unless it's voted for by the Low Council), then elections happen among the people.

(PRND) Shiphouse (Slivihüis in the PRND) has been setup in Portastorik (Westernmost town in Nobra Disky) It ships goods accross the world in fast times by using fast ships, dropoff points, canal deliveries and delivery by train when available. If you would like to be able to trade with other countries using this fast method, setup a shiphouse warehouse (preferrably in your coast or capital). You will be required to pay commercial tax to the Dysk Bereau of Income (mostly covered by the Shiphouse Company in Vhreskirhat, ask for details)

      Year 2
