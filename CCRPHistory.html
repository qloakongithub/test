   Temporary Peace
______________________

CROK becomes neutral

Kigou Onbáng announces the free business act of Elestiyanj, which puts trust into Elestiyanjis and allows them to make and run companies without extreme government surveillance. Many foreigners think this will be a first step in freedom in Elestiyanj

The TE prepares a large army as fears of an alliance war mounts.

Pesten builds a HUGE army as it is scared since many people are against it's new act.

Elestiyanj starts using propaganda to recruit people into its army, we also say that we will not attack anyone unless Elestiyanj or a GDU member is attacked first.

Kalonip Industries introduces himself as the first company we benefit nations Powder(gun powder company) and much more we will make frigates muskets and much more you should buy at us.

Skelmrelm produces 10000 muskets, 2000 pistols, 20000 sabers and 30 cannons. The cost is 140 tons timber, 470 tons metal and 2400 k nocks.

Kalonip industries relationship with many countries we ask all countries if we can make our building there to make our influence go worldwide we will pay 500K nocks

From the technology project: "Elestiyanj build 510,000 muskets for our military for 5100 timber, 5100 metal, and 35,700,000 nocks. We then build 200,000 sabers for 3000 metal and 7,000,000 nocks. We stop military related investments from there for a while"

Elestiyanj begin to train new military units. We use some unused land nearby Sarakshél as a training area

The Balkan Republic increases army wages to GBX300/person (GBX stands for G'ivol Brihschact Xeriv, or Intranational Balkan Currency). 1 GBX = 1.1nock. The army wages increased prompt many able-bodied homeless/poor people to join the army, as well as many middle-class, and our army size rises to 900,000 active, with another 102,000 reserves.

The Balkan Republic modify the MOW to incorporate a catamaran design, reducing costs, increasing efficiency, but also lowering power, but increasing speed. 12 of these are built for 3kt metal, 6kt timber, and 600ton canvas, canvas is gotten from our farms, same with timber.

The Kalonip industries makes a Safehouse for the President and the Chairman in Tal'dorese and in Elestiyanj and Skemrelm paying them all 2M nocks

Tanerdamian commends Pesten for their law supporting human rights.

Tanerdamian seeks to purchase metal in exchange for wood or fish.

(Balkan Republic) 1,000 cannons are consstructed for 2k metal, 1k wood, as well a single water mill, but since our population is largely fish-eating, with small amounts of rice, other seafood, we do not need many. Oh and 5,000 sabers, which are forged in katana style and hardened with titanium and other strong metals.

selling 490K muskets buy now from the Kalonip industries

(Balkan Republic) We ramp up fish production, in peactime using our catamarans as fishing boats and sinking money into local fishing companies. We also begin salt production for 50,000 nocks and begin building military bases, 3 in Sarajevo, a Naval station by Athenia, one near PRND, one on the herbana island w0ith T4, and one on the south near Spartae, another near southport, as well as erecting defense lines near PRND

The spheres of influence of the Kalonip Industries are Balkan federation, Elestiyanj Stermrelm, Tal'dorese, Tanerdamian republic,Herbanal republic hooray im the progressing nation

(CROK) We are sailing to pestan on new brand new ships. 2 ships are sailing to pesten to coungrats them for joining gdu. Alao on 1 of ship there is a small ortchestra that plays anthem of crok

(Pesten) I officially send 2 ships to CroK including 10k wood, 5k food and 100 muskets.

(Kalonip Industries) anyone pls trade me for 10 sailing ships for 200 muskets

(Tal'dorei) I'm looking to start a trade deal for food gathering. In total, I need about 130K tons of food, but I can have multiple people in this deal. If you have wood, you can help too: https://ccrpiv.miraheze.org/wiki/Resource_Deposits . I have mostly BM up for grabs, but I could offer some nocks as well.

(Pesten) CCRP IV is about to get it's first ever athletic games event, THE OLYMPICS! Join for the Normani Olympics which starts in 31st July, 2:00 PM UTC for the games. Since this is the first one, all countries have to make a team by filling this forum: Country Name: _ No. of Athletes: _ Team Captain (name): _

Tanerdamian is currently looking for food, building materials, and fuel.

The Amtabol company officially established. Centers of Gambling/Lottery will be opened soon

Citizens of the SIA And tamerdamian rep, can enter BR cities with a proof of ID, and a proof of citizenship in SIA/TR. they need nothing else and can move freely within BR and access countries the BR has deals with (none at the moment)

Elestiyanj outlaws gambling

CRoK outlaws gambling

Herbana limits gambling, with only 3 Gambling centers in major cities, which are heavily Surveyed by the Council.

(Ambatol Company) Ok, everyone is just gossiping about my single gambling thing. I removed gambling from the list and only let lotteries slip. If more complications "emerge their ugly heads from the bushes," I'd move on to seperatist movements. If all doesn't work, Id just scan the map until i find a country that looks unstable and then put up rebellion

Pesten bans lottery tickets over 100k nocks. (sorry kefon. need to do my contribution as the richer will get richer and poorer will get poorer if they are over 100k nocks. i think.)

We send 3 of our ships to explore 1,500 miles to the south. if nothign will be found we will go back. if somethign happens to ships there are things to do: pick up crew os sinking ship. countiniu goin.

Citizens of GDU countries can travel into the TE without a visa so long as they have a legal ID identifying them as citizens of a GDU country. Also, the TE makes gambling with odds worse than 1/1000 and prizes more than 12,000 Nocks illegal. In addition, there is a 7% tax put on the gambling company for all legal sells. Putting the tax on customers is illegal.

(CROK) on our 3 ships we put 500 people and 50 tons of food for them to survive. goodluck, explorers of the great republic!

(BR, in response to CROK) 1 Man-o-war pursues your ships, catching up as your ships use about half of their food and provide food to your ships, and fishing nets, and join up with them

Tanerdamian is currently looking for food, building materials, fuel, and canvas.

Crok is developing a new laguange! Caik En Gag

(Elestiyanj) https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/716058055/ - we do an expedition, anyway the ship is one of those prebuilt ones you start with, we load our ship with 30 men and 30 tons of food or however much they need

(Kalonip) Ehrmmm we'll pay 500K nocks for a country to let us build our building there to increase our spheres of influence and we would likely want to trade for food

     Start of Hostile Relations
____________________________________

(Tal'dorei) I begin fishing the F2 deposit by the Balkan Republic. I don't care if they attack me for it as I'm running out of food.

(Tal'dorei) I dispute the ownership of the F2 deposit by the Balkan Republic.

(BR, in response to Tal'dorei) I send 4,100 men and 3 man o war to defend our deposit as we largely rely on fish for food

(Pesten) THE OLYMPICS IS ABOUT TO BEGIN! I need every single country in the world to reply to this comment to participate in the Olympics. Any reply counts as a yes.

the Tanerdamian Republic builds 40 looms, 39,000 muskets, 41,000 pistols, and 1,000 sabers. the Tanerdamian Republic is still looking for fuel.

(Ambatol) Expedition is still continuing while plans for country establishment when land is reached are being shaped

      The First War
___________________________

(Tal'dorei) I declare war on the Balkan Republic.

Elestiyanj provides Tal'dorese soldiers with food and fuel

(Tal'dorei) Invasion plan: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/716280973/

Tanerdamian trains 80,000 soldiers and builds 3 sailing ships along with two men of war.

(CROK) We ask balkan republic to not remove our political ties and countiniu our relation as CroK is a neutral coutnry and wants a good relation with every one. we are not choosign a side, we just stay neutral.

by a slim margin, Tanerdamian announces support for the Balkan Republic against the Empire, but due to heavy isolationist sentiment in the country, it’s unlikely that the Republic will become involved.

(Kalonip) We ask all GDU nations to not attack any building that The Kalonip Industries made we are neutral in this war you could either go to my marketplace to buy muskets it doesnt matter i dont have political sides and we want good relations with the GDU AND THE SIA we do not want our company to be involved in this war thank you

Pesten help Tal'dorese empire by sending 10k troops.

Skelmrelm produces 3 men of war and 70K muskets for 2200T metal, 3700T timber, 150T canvas and 900 M nocks
