<pre>They say the world began in a place known as the Valley of Priyoriya. Long before the oceans rose, and the valleys shattered, it was the place that legends are built around: where ancient battles were fought, where long-gone heroes earned their titles, and where all of that was a bygone era, and prosperity reigned. They called it Eddenarah, a name meaning "the peace of home."

But then came the Flood.

In the Very, Very, Very Beginning
The world was all one continent. Seseco, and Mocze, and places even as far away as what the fools of today call Northern Odorslat - all were bunched up together in one large landmass that records indicate was called "Pryr" - likely the precursor to Priyoriya. Scientists say humanity began on modern-day Mocze, but the legends tell of several great wars (and archaeology concurs that there were, at the very least, sharp, pointy things in the area) and in the end a large settlement in the Free Land of Marricopra, the remnant of a once-great Kingdom.

The natives call the area Eddenarah, which brings us back to the legend.

The Eddenarans speak of seven Great Wars, each more spectacularly gory than the last. Each was ended by its own Great Hero, but natives seem only to remember the first name of the last one: Machrannah, who apparently united the peoples of the area into one. Eddenaran tales tell of a great city sandwiched between the mountains of Odorslat and the Priyor Mountains - the area called the Valley of Priyoria.

It was an almost horribly lush land, greatly conducive to the growing of all manner of plants, the breeding of all manner of animals, and the thriving of a civilization to rival all that came before and after... until disaster struck.

The Flood
The end of the world as Eddenarah knew it came in the form of a massive asteroid collision. It shattered the continents, created the Centrius Basin, and most importantly, made way for the greatest disaster then known to mankind: the Flood. The Hydropocalypse.

Even worse, it split Eddenarah in two.

The Priyor side, at least, stayed united, but the Odorslat mountains and a scrap of land there ended up on the north side of the channel created by the collision.

So much land was lost. Mocze, a sacred land to the Order of the Everlasting Fire, drifted far away. The Order left soon after, on a large fleet of boats that no one ever heard from again. Seseco, along with a large amount of valuable materials, drifted even farther, and then split from Del Sacarmo, stranding the people there.

The area of the collision filled with water, and was inhabitable for many centuries afterwards.

Post-Flood
All that is known of this time is chaos. Etchings in rocks show images of pillars of fire descending from the heavens, of great clouds of dust spreading across the land, and lots and lots of screaming stick figures. Many in Eddenarah would rather deny this time existed - they were, after all, the greatest power in the world; why shouldn't they have been able to cope with it?

But then the dust cleared. The new coastlines were mapped. And Eddenarah began a new chapter of its history.

The Beginning of Known Time
Main Article: Arachus Betznel

They created a statue of him, right in the middle of their city. Even today, it's still visible, if worn down. A man in a fluttery, sweeping cloak, standing atop a large clock, and pointing North, as if to acknowledge their brethren across the channel.

The Father of Time. Sometimes merely Father Time.

But to those who knew him best, he was merely Arachus Betznel, a man who made clocks and had the bright idea of deciding to designate the date of his birth as Year One, Day One.

Soon family and friends adopted it, an uncle of his made a calendar, and 52 years after the Flood, Priyor-Eddenarah celebrated its first New Year's on the first day of the month of Adarus.

The people declared Arachus their leader, and he and his time-making family set to work creating clocks, calendars, and an extensive written history of their city.

And so Eddenarah prospered.

Whatever Happened to Odorslat?
The people of Odorslat - for that was when they named the area - became bitter. Of course those cursed Priyoriyans didn't attempt to make contact. Of course the Priyorians got the better side of the valley.

Odorslatian Eddenarah became a weary, angry people. They accustomed themselves to the cold, but with great grumblings and murmurings. They hunted in the mountains above them, and there found their true calling: military. So Odorslat organized its armies, and they conquered the peoples in the mountains above them.

They were an angry people, but they, too, thrived.

Interlude
One day they realized the Priyor mountains had moved, and they got mad.

Then they realized this didn't really mean anything.

Except for Jimmy.

Because Jimmy now had to walk 5 miles between his house and his work.

But nobody cared about Jimmy.

The People of the Lobster: circa 543 AY
Across the Vizantus Strait flourished a land of lobster-worshiping peoples. They had received the brunt of the collision, but came to accept it as the fate the Great Nephrops had handed them, and continued to serve him with fear, trembling, lemons, parsley, and butter sauce (as befits a lobster).

The Lizard-fearing peoples of Eddenarah didn't like them, and so went to war over the Centrius Archipelago, because they both thought that inhabitable islands in the middle of a nearly circular sea made for a perfectly dramatic location for a shrine. The wars lasted several hundred years, and while Eddenarah had the upper hand at first, the Lobsterites gradually improved. When they unified under the name Children of Nephrops then they routed Eddenarah off of the islands.

In year 543 AY (Arachus years), the Homaric Pact laid claim to the islands, built a giant shrine, and posted several hundred armed guards outside.

Eddenarah took the hint, though they were very salty about it.

What We Mere Mortals Call the Dark Ages
Main Article: Dark Ages

Between the 543 and 826 AY, the only nation that managed to flourish were the Children of Nephrops (they said this proved that Great Nephrops was superior to all other gods; the Eddenaran Delegation then sicced several thousand lizards on them and said they didn't do it).

The people of Mocze became very religious; the people of Odorslat had so many civil wars it wasn't even funny (especially the War of the Fluffy Unicorns); Del Sacarmo over-farmed itself and suffered through exactly 12,391 sandstorms; Gusmoas flooded again and again and again; and Eddenarah had a problem by the name of Jimmy.

The Jimmy Rebellion
I will write about this later.

Marricopra Enters the Stage: 830-992 AY
In 830 AY, Eddenarah, restyled the Kingdom of Marricopra, and led by King Jimmy the 9th, invaded its entire continent, and then sent a large delegation to the Children of Nephrops (CoN) just to say "HA!" The CoN sent more troops to the Great Island of Nephrops, but Marricopra merely smiled at this.

The new Kingdom sent delegations to Odorslat - then the Empire of the Knitted Socks. Odorslat didn't know what to think of this, and were at first very angry for how long it took Eddenarah to contact them, but now that Marricopra was offering money and access to warmer lands, the Empire jumped at the chance to create an alliance. Marricopra not-so-subtly hinted that they wanted the Knitted Socks troops, and the Empire took the bait, sending one hundred thousand soldiers south to what is today known as Altar.

While preparing for an invasion of Centrius (which was at this point really just a matter of pride), Marricopra distracted everyone by sending most of their army to Seseco to help the long-gone Verst Empire with their civil war. As soon as this was over, they quickly jumped at the chance for an alliance, "borrowed" another hundred thousand troops, and set off for their grand invasion out of Altar.

Everyone Goes to War
(For reference, it is about 992 AY.)

The Empire of the Knitted Socks (Odorslat) set their sights even farther northward but encountered impressive resistance from the people of Smiggity-smoogity. This started another war, which Marricopra did not care about.

Del Sacarmo finally had the sense to make boats, restyle itself the Kingdom of People Who Are Really Tired of Dust, and set out for Seseco. They claimed a small plot of land on the coast and immediately began farming. The Verst Empire declared war, but the KoPWARToD set up a REALLY big sign that simply said "NO."

Because Verst didn't really care about the land, they let them be.

Mocze had a problem in that everyone there loved to light things on fire for No Good Reason, and so while there wasn't much habitable land to begin with, there was even less now. Right in the dead center of the continent was the barren headquarters of the Order of the Everlasting Flame, which wasn't strictly a country but no one dared touch it. Because if they did, they might just find their supplies mysteriously set aflame. Mocze became known as a land of barbarians - even more so than Odorslat - and so they all hunted and starved themselves nearly to extinction.

Except for that one scrap of land in the North. They were too close to Seseco for anyone to care.

Guzmoas was only barely recovering from the 33rd Flood of 993 AY when Marricopra sent some soldiers and resources and said, "knock yourself out." This created a small Marricopran-Guzmoan population that had an odd sense of patriotism for both countries, declared war on itself, and otherwise created a distraction for the world and themselves while Marricopra executed its grand plan.

In 995 AY, Marricopran, Verst, and Odorslatan soldiers laid seige to the Great Island of Nephrops. The CoN responded with the full might of their army, while Marricopra called in favors to almost everyone (except for the Order). It was the bloodiest war since the Seventh Great War of Eddenarah, and nearly ended in stalemate, except that Marricopra finally let the Order help, and they set fire to the CoN's capital.

The CoN surrendered, Marricopra celebrated by demolishing the Great Shrine, and Guzmoas only then realized that they had missed out on a "truly epic war," (according to Marricopran historian Aba Laba Baba).

The Golden Age of Almost Everyone: 1000-1206 AY
For the next two hundred years, Marricopra had control of the whole continent of Pryr, as well as Centrius, and the moderately sized desert-y island of Ustrusus. They turned their attention inward, building up their infrastructure, creating an education system, and actually stopping politicians from creating nonsense laws that did nothing but give them money. They also opened trade with the new nation of Tressene (which they pretended hadn't declared independence from them), gave financial support to Odorslat as it finally overthrew Smiggity-smoogity, and gave the Order some money for their trouble helping in the Really Big War.

Odorslat, in the meantime, finally pushed their armies past the mountains to even colder terrain, and decided to call themselves the much more reasonable Grand Republic of Odorslat. They, too, built roads across their country, even tunneling through what had once been the forbidding mountains.

The Verst Empire had its heyday, with lots of vaguely Russian-sounding Emperors who wielded Unlimited Power (mostly) for good. They also sowed the seeds of their own demise, but that's unimportant.

Tressene basked in the glory of its newfound freedom and became known for hosting entirely too many parties (which proved detrimental to its economy not to far in the future), but with seemingly endless Marricopran support, they felt free to spend outrageous amounts of money on things such as the The Moon Looks Pretty Tonight, Why Don't We Have a Party? Festival, and the Party of the Year (a title which everyone tried to claim, but only the government-hosted ones really could).

The Kingdom of People Who Are Really Tired of Dust - even they thrived on new, non-dusty soil.

The CoN, meanwhile, sat and sulked on its own continent, wallowing in its misery and planning its revenge.

1206 AY: The CoN Starts World War Three
On the 5th day of the month of Machrannah, one thousand, two hundred, and six years after Arachus made his calendar, the CoN very officially declared war on Marricopra, by way of a delegation of 60 (later known as, literally, the Delegation of the Sixty) and a very tasseled and calligraphied paper that, in essence, said: "you stole our land from us, so we're going to take it back, and if it means we have to kill all of yours and your allies' soldiers, then that's your problem." Marricopra responded by sending everyone of fighting age to Centrius, and they were locked in stalemate with the CoN for an entire year, until King Billy Bob the 3rd called on Odorslat for help, and they finally gained the advantage.

For a time.

However, the KoPWARToD had pity on the CoN, which had struggled for two centuries, and decided to side with them in the conflict. They didn't have a particularly large army, but they were very enthusiastic, and managed to push back the Marricopran-Odorslatian Alliance to the central island. Government entities considered calling on Tressene at almost the exact same time, but as the treasury of said nation was almost completely depleted, they "politely declined." To this day they insist so, though what they actually did was send a letter that said, in KoPWARToD style, "NO."

Seseco was embroiled in its own conflict, both aided and abetted by the Order, and eventually abandoned by the Moczen fanatics in favor of what was now being called World War Three (whatever the first had been, no one knew, but everyone knew that at least pre-Flood the whole world had been at war at some point). This created a schism within the Order, as half wanted to support the CoN's more traditional approach to warfare, but the other half supported Marricopra as they were, after all, their distant cousins (this latter half became the precursors to Gondolinius).

The two sides of the Order met at the Vizantus Strait, creating yet another stalemate.

After two and a half years of the world's most pointless war, everyone gave up. Centrius was split between Marricopra and the CoN. The Order split Mocze in two and tried not to fight over it.

South Seseco
Seseco, for most of it's history was fairly isolated. It's main powers were the many Norreik States and the Verst Empire.

South Seseco is also a place of many inventions, the Traffic Signal (1872, Saint Vennes, Deprivique), Printing Press (1450, Burges, Grand Duchy of Burges) and Controlled Access Motorway (1913, Kvev, Tornobyl) were all invented here.

The West
The most common legend about the formation of the Verst Empire is that a family emmigrated west from their native lands of Tornobyl to the vast, unclaimed tundra that was The North of South West Seseco. These lands were typically referred to as Chyeve meaning West of the Chkyiv (mountains). They built a small village on the coast of their new home, coincidentally close to a busy ship route. Since the Chyeve at this point was mainly unsettled the village was the perfect spot for a harbour. This shifted the main harbour for goods coming into South Seseco in the east from Lehaska to Early Verst (the name seems to have originated from the word Vestrem in Mountain Tongue, quite literally meaning "The Busy Harbour". We do not know why the mountain people had a specific word for this). This change halted Lehaska's growth as a town and it's population has been on the decrease ever since. In the modern day, seeing as it is on a tri-border with Norreik and the Chyeve it is an unfavourable place to live.

Early Verst would continue to grow at a great pace and so did it's kingdom, the Verst Empire that now controlled most of The North of South West Seseco. In the south another power was developing.

The Grand Duchy of Burges's formation was a bit more violent. Six villages were located along the Burges Estuary and they never stopped fighting. These people who lived in the villages were probably natives but we can't be sure because people started moving west at this time. One village, Kantes built a harbour (this one came before Early Verst) and became an economic powerhouse. The other villages wanted in on this and built their own harbours. Eventually the estaury was so crowded that ships were hitting into eachother and crews of each were fighting with the others over right of way. The villages, at this point saw that fighting would only weaken them, so they joined together in 1480 to form the Grand Duchy of Burges with Burges coming from the Old Fronien "Burnnionen Ges" meaning The City of Many Ports. The four further in harbours were demolished soon after.

The two sides united in 1550 to form the Chkyeb Uniate. Expansion continued eastward. In 1620 a civil war began.

The Jenois War of 1620
Jenois was an exclave of people who remained in the Mountain Culture. They called themselves Kruchtevs (a common term used to refer to them in a negative light was "Crookies") and their capital was Kauter. Jenois City, as we know it today was an orsk catholic outpost that spoke Letique. The Kruchtevs were under severe penal laws, below is a basic rundown:

Crookies may not buy land unless the land had been owned by another Crookie.
Crookies may not go to school.
Crookies could not practice religion.
Crookies may only speak Letique.
Crookies may not possess anything that could be used to defend themselves
A maximum of one shop could be opened by a Crookie in any one town.
Crookies could only shop at places owned by Crookies.
Crookies could not ride carriages or own horses.
So on, So forth
The first "Crookie Uprising" was actually in 1590 but it failed miserably and half of Kauter was burned to the ground. In 1620, with help from the Tornobyl Arms Association they were able to start a revolution in Kauter. The surrounding area was quickly captured and the Kruchtev Union was declared. They were followed by Deprivique, a region also descriminated against because of their Vizantian Catholic faith. Together the two new nations took over everything east of the Chkyiv Mountains. At home, the Uniate was struggling to keep the peace as a new disease called "Crookpox" (named so because many believed it was a consequence of discriminating against the Kruchtevs) was running rampant throughout the country. The Kruchtev Union, Deprivique Republic and Letoque State (Puppet of Deprivique) were given fully recognised independance.

Reunited
In 1720, Letoque joined Deprivique to create the Holy Vizantian Union. The Kruchtev Union united with the City State of Tornve to create the New Kruchtev State. In 1722 the Grand Duchy of Burges reunited with the Verst Empire and in 1723 a war began.

War of Letoque (1723 - 1770)
On the 3rd September 1723 the 2nd Chkyeb Union declared war on the Holy Vizantian Union and the New Kruchtev State. At first, their attack was strong, they took over Tornve and many mountanious regions. But then winter hit.

The counteroffensive was described by a verst survivor as "Fast and sharp". They mainly attacked at nigh tand in small numbers. The Verst army was pushed all the way back to Verst. By then Tornobyl joined the war and more reinforcements were coming from allied nations. The war went on like this for 47 years. Then they decided they would better just unite, lest lose anymore lives.

The East
Meanwhile, on the east (1530): The wast was dominated by a few warring nations, and a city state. Let's start with the city state. Torvne was a city state located on the south of Seseco. They were the business, trade and population hub for southern Seseco and basically the entirety of East South Seseco was under their influence. It is not known how the city actually begun but it is likely it was a few merges as it was (and still is) absolutely massive. They spoke a strange variation of the Mountain Tongue, Orsk. Because of this Orsk became the political language for everyone in South Seseco. Anyone of any importance spoke it fluently.

Immediately north of Torvne was "The Holy States of Tornobyl, birthplace of Helle, The One True God". Tornobyl usually referred to the region north of the Chyev Mountains, but it is worth noting that it's identity reached down to the ends of the Chkyiv Mountains. Tornobyl was made up of 8 states, usually all fighting each other. These were The Prysom Kingdom, Holy Vekke, Kvev State, Frisya Kingdom, People of the Chkyiv, We, of N'Thrové, Grand Duchy of Nethrov and the Hanner Kingdom. Unification of Tornobyl was very slow and very violent. Usually there was always one main state that controlled the majority of the land. In 1530 that was The Prysom Kingdom. They went on a rampage, attacking first the Kvev State, then the People of the Chkyiv and all the other states soon followed. Their first flag has the religious worlds toward "Helle, The One True God" and also eight stars to represent the eight states.


Flag of tornobyl, it is the same to this day
Deprivique
Deprivique was the region on the Deprivique Peninsula on the very southernmost point of East Seseco. They speak Devreb there, a very english sounding language. Deprivique natives originated from somewhere along the Vizantus Strait. They left their homeland of Dovranland due to a war with some neighboring power. We don't know how long ago this was, but best historians estimate that it was during the Post Flood era.


Mural in Petersport depicting the natives of Deprivique leaving their homeland circa 1198
Deprivique was two kingdoms, the Grand Duchy of Hallem and the Kingdom of Leynes (now Petersport). They united in 748 to form the Deprivique Union. They were invaded by their neighbour, Letoque to the north ~912 during the Letoque Conquests. While they were independant not much notable happened.
Jenois
Today Jenois is a disputed canton in the Orsk Federation (Officially it is part of the canton Letoque Jenois) It does not have a very unique culture at all, they are basically just people from the Chkyiv Mountains who emmigrated west and met the Letoque people. Something that is notable about them is that they were hit incredibly hard during the Lacertiliitis. Almost three quarters of their population died, half of the remaining emmigrated. The city of Jenois was almost empty by 1900. They repopulated at very impressive rates, and today the region has a population of 1.4 Million.

Letoque
Letoque is and always was the dominant power in the West. The people of Letoque (Letiquain)'s origins are unknown but we think they came from the same place as the Tornoblites. The capital of Letoque is Saint Vennes. It is the second most populous canton in the Orsk Federation but has no city over one million in population. Over it's history Letoque has had a very unique take on land, similar to that of the Russian Empire. This encouraged people to spread out which is why they are significantly less dense than the other cantons.

Letoque is home to Jenois, a disputed canton in it's east.

Letoque lost land and was eventually destroyed in the Letoque Wars which lasted from 1610 - 1670 and main belligrents were the Verst Empire and Grand Duchy of Burges (GDB seceded from the Chkyeb Uniate in 1620).

Summary
South Seseco has had a history of civil wars, disease and violent wars, however it has also had times of prosperity. The "Seseco Golden Age" was the time from 1723 - 1803 both started and ended by war, but during which there was no fighting and instead inventions, discoveries and industrialisation.

The Tressene Wars: 1206-1229
The Almighty Chiefdom of Tressene split in two after the Bi-Centennial Festival, in which the country realized it had literally 2 units of its currency left, and the older 50% of the population, sick of parties, launched an assault on the Treehouse Palace (honestly, who wouldn't have a palace in a treehouse?), and started the second Gusmoas Civil War. The native population jumped into the battle, which made it incredibly unclear exactly who was on what side, and what, exactly, they were fighting for.

Eventually the lines of the conflict became clearer as the northwest section of the country called themselves the Party of the Party; the southern, coastal area named themselves Silencio (and built a bunch of factories as an In-Your-Face to the PotP); and the native conglomeration called themselves exactly that (The Gusmoas Conglomeration) and put spears covered in flags all over the former capital and glutted themselves on what was left of Tressene's resources.

Needless to say, Silencio eventually won the conflict by simply having what historians call "more stuff." They became a world power within a decade and a half of their creation, and expanded all over Gusmoas, until several native groups confined them to the southeast and Croissant Island. Which was fine by them, because they needed to work on infrastructure.

So ended Tressene, as well as the Gusmoan wars, for the next long while.

1281-1301: Exactly Twenty Years of Peace
As Silencio settled down after the war, Marricopra and the CoN rebuilt while Odorslat focused on diplomatic outreach to the KoPWARToD. This created a very close alliance between the two that lasts to this day, if only culturally (even after the eventual dissolution of Odorslat). Marricopra decided to build up its armies, and finally sent some officials to Ustrusus to manage the situation down there. They found that the island had figured the Kingdom had abandoned them, basically declared independence, and were running themselves. Marricopra decided it was okay with this, and recognized Ashmanschkra-Sevdrolet as its own nation, forming close ties with it and lending lots of financial support until this became impossible.

Seseco continued to develop, expand, and have lots of civil wars during this time (see: South Seseco).

The CoN worked on building its armies and put their side of Centrius under even heavier guard, which somehow didn't make Marricopra suspicious. However, the Ultra-Orthodox Order of the Everlasting Flame of the South kept close watch on the "Lobster Kingdom," warning Marricopra just in time for the invasion.

On Mocze, the Order struggled to rebuild after the Split, focusing more on its position as a cultural group than on their being religious fanatics. The Southern group called themselves the Ultra-Orthodox Order of the Everlasting Flame of the South, but they were the less arson-inclined group, and expanded their lands down to the coast, eventually settling there as it was much more habitable than the midland desert. In the North grew the Great and True Order of the Everlasting Flame, which eventually took over the entire desert, building their hub around a large pit of fire, always tended by mysterious hooded figures with thick accents. Both factions blatantly ignored each other in hope of not beginning another war. This worked, but to the effect that neither sect recognized each other as ever belonging to the same religion. The North group openly allied with the CoN, and purely out of spite, the South allied with Marricopra. However, both prospered (relatively) during this time.

This was the last extended period of worldwide peace for 600 years.

The Seventy-Three-And-A-Quarter Years War: 1301-1374
For those of you who are too lazy to read: basically the three powers of the Centrius Basin were at war off and on for 73 (and a quarter!) years. This was the last major war of this type, and ended with the CoN regaining control of the islands (for now...).

In the Centrius Islands, which had since World War Three been a spot of contention across Marricopra, the CoN, and even Ashmanschkra, tensions boiled over in late 1301 AY over the ownership of the southernmost isles (which Ashmanschkra claimed for itself), and all three nations laid waste to each other. Marricopra headed straight for the CoN capital, while the CoN overran all of Centrius within a day and a half. Ashmanschkra made landfall in Pryr and surrounded the city of Deppriona (in modern-day Altar). After half a year of this, all sides realized that this type of warfare was entirely unsustainable, and called a year-and-a-half ceasefire to build up their resources.

In 1304 AY, Marricopra launched an assault on Centrius, and held and defended the island for ten years. The CoN was too busy rebuilding its capital for what was at least the third time, and so it was no difficulty for Marricopra to hold back the meager Ashmanschkri army, until 1314, when the CoN rejoined the battle, heading straight for the Marricopran capital.

It was the worst destruction the area had seen since the Flood.

Marricopra immediately moved backwards to defend their capital, and while the CoN-Marricopra conflict went on in what remained of the Valley of Pryoriya, Ashmanschkra took the islands. Marricopra eventually pushed back the CoN to the far East. The loss from this set of fighting sparked another ceasefire, this one lasting four and a half years.

This truce was broken by the CoN, who made their first stab at Ashmanschkra. This time it was successful, and they officially owned the Ashmanschrki army (Sevdrolet refused to join this war. This created a rift in the country, but more on this later) for a time. However, the Army of Ashmanschkra the Inevitable refused to be owned by any other faction, and rebelled against the CoN generals, which put a slight dent in the CoN army, but mostly distracted them from the Marricopra 1326 invasion of Centrius.

Marricopra owned the islands for another 5 years, in which the CoN and Ashmanschkra banded together (ironically) to shove them out, but the Marricopran army was so large they couldn't manage this until 1332, and then Ashmanschkra turned on the CoN, and they fought it out for a few years while Marricopra went back to rebuilding and making poisons from the lizards in the only national reserve, which was overhunted anyway.

The longest ceasefire was from 1336-1343, after which Marricopra and the CoN simultaneously pulled support from the Order (both North and South). Ashmanschkra admitted defeat and decided to focus on its quickly worsening relations with the pacifist Sevdrolet. Once the Order got involved, almost everything within view was burned to the ground, Centrius became so inhabitable everyone wondered why they still fought over it, and King Vilassey of Marricopra died in battle, leaving no heirs but his niece, Nichra, who became the first Queen of Marricopra. She had little to no popular support, as she was a woman, but proved to be a brilliant strategist and brought Marricopra to an almost decisive victory at the Fourty-Fifth Battle of Great Nephrops Island, until the southern Order turned on them and Marricopra surrendered and shut its doors to the world.

The CoN claimed Centrius, renamed it the Grand Lobster Islands, and the Order went home. In 1374, the Treaty of the Lobsterites was signed (grudgingly) by CoN general Parsley and Queen Nichra, who was at the very least lauded for her dignity in the face of such a crushing defeat.

The Fireplague Epidemic: 1406-1455
The disease technically began spreading in 1402, but given the slowness of travel at the time, it didn't spread beyond the Great and True (Northern) Order until 1406.

The One and Only Everlasting Flame apparently had microbes in them. Harmful ones. And after centuries of humans tending to the fire and its odd microbiome, they latched onto the Arch-Priests, and spread throughout the Mocze Desert's tent cities. It began with the Chief Arch-Priest, Bengellus, burning with a 106 degree fever. The next day, all four other Arch-Priests woke up with the same fever, and Bengellus broke out in hives said to burn "as if the Eternal Fire had itself showered its infernal sparks upon the skin." On the third day, Bengellus began vomiting blood. On the fourth, he died.

The four remaining Arch-Priests all exhibited the same symptoms, but not within the same time frame. Hibriz died the day the boils appeared; Porops had a fever for a week and then got the boils and coughed blood (and died) all on the same day; Caprokcil only ever had boils, which lasted a week and a half and then he died with no warning; and Nezrel had a fever for two days, boils for a week and a half, and eventually recovered with only some light scarring.

From Nezrel and the other four's caretakers, the disease spread across Mocze without warning and with no cure. Only a quarter of the Northern Order survives, and they start lighting fires in what is by then proto-Gondolinius, which spreads the disease through the southern Order like wildfire, and across the ocean to Marricopra via merchant ships. Marricopra gladly passes this on to the CoN and Ashmansckra via Altar (which has begun to rebel). All the guards on Great Nephrops Island die from the disease, but no one dares go replace them for fear of becoming infected themselves.

Centrius goes unclaimed - it is during this time that Sevdrolet goes and unofficially names it the Central Archipelago, and the name sticks.

The disease is sent north to Odorslat, but very few die as the cold climate cannot sustain the archaea-bacteria [and yes, I'm basing the vaguely scientific nature of fireplague off of my 7th grade science class]. What little of the disease can spread makes its way to Del Sacarmo/KoPWARToD, where it eventually dies out but destabilizes the colonial government enough for a complete overhaul, leaving the native Oralians to kill the government and begin to rule themselves.

After killing about a fifth of the Marricopran population (including the monarch, but they had a direct heir), more than half of Mocze, and a sixth of the rest of the world, the disease eventually dies down in 1455, as the population had naturally immunized itself, save for a few sparse outbreaks in remote areas.

The War of the Chicken Pie: 1507-1509
Main Article: War of the Chicken Pie

In 1507 AY, what remained of the KoPWARToD (a small scrap of land on Seseco; now Hakha Rakhine) held the First (and only) International Baking Competition, inviting famous bakers worldwide. Among them were Gondolinius's Oragor Mentaylis, who owned the World's Largest Bakery (and nobody dared fight him on that); Sevdrolet's Jimalangang Kobrob; and the KoPWARToD's Ercal Bogefayal, whose alliance was to the Rakhine rebellion brewing up north. Upon his winning the competition, the judges had no idea what country to award the top prize to, and so (as is, of course, usual) war was declared between the KoPWARToD and Hakha Rakhine. Marricopra threw themselves into the war, angry over the loss of Ashmanschkra and Centrius centuries before (and from getting last place in the competition), and led by Queen Ingelle "the Mad."

They quickly drew out after the mysterious death of Ingelle and the ascension of King Billy Bob the Sixth, who gave the KoPWARToD several million dollars in reparations and an apology letter.

What remained of the Northern Order finally wiped themselves out by throwing themselves and their disease-ridden bodies into the war. This ended with the Treaty of the Kitchen, the formation of Hakha Rakhine and the final dissolution of the Kingdom of People Who Are Really Tired of Dust, and the subsequent breakout of fireplague across Seseco.

The Second Fireplague Epidemic: 1509-1576
The Seseco epidemic ended within a few months (see: the first fireplague epidemic and how that worked on Odorslat), but spread back south to Mocze via merchants from Santa Marino and then to Gondolinius, who sent diseased persons to Silencio and Marricopra out of spite (remember - they had their beginnings as religious fanatics). The two almost declared war in return, but then half of their armies fell ill and they decided otherwise.

This epidemic went off and on for the next seventy years, with each breakout having epicenters in oddly diverse places, among them being the new Hakha Rakhine, the southernmost 2 blocks of a city in Odorslat, and Croissant Island. This epidemic ended with the Blizzard to End All Blizzards, which lasted exactly 3 days but was enough to kill the archaea-bacteria worldwide. The disease was confined to the We Hate Fire Quarantine Hospital, which was set up in the Mocze desert over the original site of the fire to ensure no one lighted it again.

I would say there was peace from here on out, but there isn't, because this was when I remembered that tectonic plates were a thing.

The Split of Ashmanschkra and Sevdrolet: 1599 and a couple years after that
The large, desert-y island of Ashmanschkra-Sevdrolet, named after the two people groups that lived there, was situated on a fault line that became more precarious with each year after the Flood, until it finally broke apart during an earthquake and tsunami just south of the Central Archipelago, creating an event known as the Mini-Flood.

The country officially became two (it had been threatening to become so for a while), with Ashmanschkra becoming the war peoples of the west, eagerly helping Altar break from Marricopra, though the Altarians themselves didn't care too much as Marricopra provided financial support. Sevdrolet was a nation of pacifists, and remained strictly neutral in all the Central Basin conflicts, though it formed close ties with the CoN. They became known for their art, and hated being invaded. However, seeing as they had no army, this happened over and over despite their declaring independence and creating more and more statues of famous Sevdroletis, which no one cared to take down as they actually looked quite good.

The world began to be split over "do you support Ashmanschkra or Sevdrolet?" but as neither nation had the patience to fight the other, it all came to naught and everyone stopped caring, because the islands had moved into such a location to be perfect for beach vacations and millions flooded there.

The Economic Collapse of 1684
After a little less than a century of relative-but-not-really peace, war in Skelmrelm completely demolished the economy of said country, bringing upon general economic collapse worldwide, as just about everyone depended on Skelmrelm for one reason or another.

Does this name sound unfamiliar? Odorslat had, during this time, undergone yet another civil war that led to its renaming. The citizens were relieved that they were at least not called Knitted-Socks-ians.

Skelmrelm during this time had moved past Marricopra in terms of GDP (and, in some areas, development) and become the new world epicenter, especially for the north. Gondolinius still considered Marricopra their main provider, however, and Silencio found the Kingdom easier to access. However, whatever petty disputes they had became unimportant in the face of total annihilation of all they'd worked for.

However, with the discovery of oil deposits on Sevdrolet, the world economy slowly rebuilt as nations focused southward, and then back North after the Skelmrelm war ended. By 1690, the world economy had generally stabilized.

The 1775 Great Earthquake of Odorslat
This is why the mountains have two main ranges.

However, though the epicenter of this was in the mountains, aftershocks were so strong in the capital (on that bay just south of them) that it was completely demolished. This created a political split over who should rule where and how they should rebuild, and effectively ended the Republic of Odorslat as it was known.

War broke out over the ruins of Odorslat-Priyoria, ending with the Treaty of What's Left of Priyoriya that split the country in four: Skelmrelm, the Republic of Saldon, the Kingdom of the Remnant, and the Spire Realm. The Kingdom of the Remnant was basically a puppet state of both Saldon and Skelmrelm, but at different times, seeing as it was located on the ruins of Priyoriya and only populated by a few thousand, mostly scholars and archaeologists there to study and preserve what was left of the city.

Odorslat once again was no longer a world power, and Silencio began to compete with Marricopra for the title of highest GDP, until the 1794 Marricopran Revolution (see: The We're Sick of King Salamandario Revolution), after which the country turned inward to sort out its own problems.

By 1799, the world was caught in a precarious balance between Skelmrelm and Silencio, as they had no access to Marricopra's resources (except for Sevdrolet, which the Kingdom just couldn't ignore).

This resulted in a slight dip in the economy ~1800, but it eventually stabilized as Silencio began to compensate, and finally Marricopra (which had at last rid itself of Altar) reentered the world, about half the size it had been before.

Lacertiliitis: 1837-1850
The disease began among the thousands of lizard species found at Great Lacertilia National Park. Still no one knows exactly which species spread it to humans, but the story goes like this: shopowner Tylline Tortatolus and his family visited the park in Firbicus 1837, and three weeks after returning, his wife died. Within the next two days, both of his children complained of pain in their mouth, throat, and stomach. Two days later, they died.

Tylline lasted long enough to tell his neighbors of the strange occurrence, and then died in the home of musician Vollus Senddarry. The disease spread from the Senddarry household across the small town of Markpinne. The disease made it via caravan to the capital, and spread quickly through the population there. Then-Queen Nichra III soon realized what was happening and enforced a quarantine in the northeast part of the city, but not before boats carrying timber - the country's main resource - had reached Saldon, Gondolinius, and Oralotzo, spreading the disease there too.

Soon testing was performed in the King Jimmy Central Hospital, and it was found that the disease turned one's saliva to hydrochloric acid. Scientists worldwide set to work creating a vaccine, but the most they could do was prevent death, though not entirely. Certain anomalies were found in the poorer parts of the city, where most of the population had already gone through a bout of Lizard Pox, a non-fatal disease spread by the Greeg lizard. Those who had already had the Pox were naturally immune to the disease - named Lacertiliitis after the park where it originated - and so many were hired on as doctors or even merely recipients of tests. They were paid by the government for their trouble, and often hired and paid ridiculous amounts of money to take over positions unstaffed because of the epidemic.

Throughout the rest of the world scientists worked aggressively on creating a vaccine, or, in the case of Ashmanschkra, spreading Lizard Pox to as many citizens as possible. Because of this, most of the population had a natural immunity to Lacertiliitis by 1848. It is considered one of the most effective public health initiatives to date.

Saldon and Skelmrelm teamed up to create a semi-effective vaccine, which forced out the virus by the second day, often leaving people on the brink of death but at least alive. They took to spreading numbing shots among their population, which at least prevented the pain caused from the acidic saliva. The vaccine was spread with the Kingdom of the Remnant, which consented to being absorbed into Skelmrelm, but the Spire Realm told themselves they could "handle this."

They were all dead in three weeks.

Gondolinius learned to work with the disease, and the hot climate created its first mutation, spread by melted cells. This resulted in a burning sensation throughout the body, which the Southern Order (now a strong theo-political presence in the area) promoted as a religious experience, not knowing how deadly the disease was. Lacertiliitis and the "Fire of the Heavens" mutation spread even more rapidly throughout Gondolinius and eventually to the abandoned We Hate Fire Hospital, which still had the remains of fireplague all over it. The Imperialist Party of Gondolinius set up an initiative to promote the quarantining of sick individuals. The Southern Order fought back against this relentlessly, creating a split in the general population over whether or not the "Fire of the Heavens" phenomena was a religious experience or a serious medical condition. Those who considered it religious were eventually put in a mental hospital during the Second Apocalypse, and the rest ran away to the desert.

That aside, the disease died out in the urban parts of Gondolinius, but thrived in the rural areas around the Fireplague hospital, which created it's own problem, but more on that later...

In the CoN, where the disease was spread from Marricopra via Sevdrolet and the oilfield workers there, the disease also mutated, creating something similar to the "Fire of the Heavens" bacteria, but instead causing only the skin to burn and dry out. This version wasn't completely fatal, even though Lizard Pox wasn't prevalent among the CoN. It was thought that the melting of the cells in the unceasing heat lessened the effects, but the disease was eradicated in 1845 due to a spike in heat and a drought, and so was never able to be studied.

By 1850, the disease had calmed down worldwide (except for Gondolinius, but that's next).

Lacertiliitis-Fireplague Meltdown: 1895-1901
The worst pandemic known to mankind. It began in what was renamed the Great Imperial Quarantine Hospital in central Gondolinius (the site has once again been abandoned, and is no longer owned by the country), where the archaea-bacteria known as fireplague had lain dormant on all the abandoned tools, beds, and especially in the indent in the floor that had once been the One and Only Everlasting Flame. As Lacertiliitis patients flooded in, using all the infected equipment and lying in the fireplague-infested beds, the two diseases began to combine, resulting in the first case of what was known, rather creatively, as "Lacertiliitis-fireplague."

The first recorded patient was Appap Nipzap, a dockworker, of southern Gondolinius. He first reported a 106-degree fever - the universal signal of fireplague - and the next day his skin turned red, and he was said to claim it "burned worse than the Fire of the Heavens" (a disease he had, at first, survived). Three days after first reporting a fever, the red receded, turning into small boils that bled. After five days he appeared to be recovering, until he reported the signifying mouth-esophagus-stomach pain that came with Lacertiliitis.

After a week, he finally coughed up blood and died.

The new mutation spread throughout the hospital faster than even the Fire of the Heavens, apparently being more contagious than any previous strain (spread via touch), leaving only two survivors - very pregnant women - who had a strange natural immunity.

Lacertiliitis-fireplague spread slowly south and then trickled through the poorer, non-immune southern Gondolinius population. Before the Gondolinian government could figure out what was happening, thousands of carriers, sick, and healthy alike had boarded boats to Gusmoas and Oralotzo, one of the world's least populated areas. This mass exodus became the downfall of Imperial Gondolinius, but not quite yet.

The sick aboard the Gusmoas-bound boats all died on the way, and only four remained and made it to land. They set fire to the boats they came on and as they incorporated themselves into the Silencian population, millions more died. The several dozens remaining declared themselves Gods and fled into the mountains, only to be discovered nearly a century later by the Orsk Federation. Silencio collapsed, utterly and completely, and the land became inhabitable, overrun by plants, weeds, and rabid animals.

On Del Sacarmo, which was still dry and dusty from the sandstorms that plagued them almost a thousand years ago, received the refugees with open arms, only to kill three-quarters of the population. Only those in the North survived, quarantining themselves.

The Orsk Federation received the disease via shipments from Santa Marino, and only went into lockdown after half of the population had been killed.

Sometime during this the disease makes its way to Marricopra, where it kills King Jimmy the Nineteenth (and last), sending the Kingdom into upheaval.

By 1896 the whole world is in lockdown, save for Odorslat, which can't sustain itself very well and goes to war. Saldon and Skelmrelm begin a decades-long war over the general control of Odorslat, which is slowly starving to death.

Skelmrelm decides to send all of its scientists to the Central Archipelago, and other countries follow suit. The Shrine of the Great Star Lobster becomes a giant lab, with everyone working according to their own time zone schedule so work is always being done. In 1897 a vaccine is created by a team of Skelmish, Altarian, and Sevdroleti scientists.

By 1901, the vaccine is distributed worldwide and rebuilding begins.

Until the Second End of the World comes.

The Second Apocalypse: 1906
For a land inhabited by a religious group whose only claim to fame was that they started fires incessantly, there was only one Fire War.

There were 12 - exactly twelve, and three were children - members of the Northern Order left. They lived a little North of the We Hate Fire Hospital, in tents, and obsessively lit up random patches of desert.

Every year they got more and more mad at the financial support lent to the Southern Order and those who defected from the North, until they were all positively boiling with anger and in 1906 set fire to the capital of Gondolinius. Gondolinius assumed it was Marricopra - as they were prone to do, after the Seventy-Three-and-A-Half-Years War - and declared war on the very weakened kingdom.

And then it happened.

The fires, as it turned out, were still full of fireplague - somehow - and within a week both Gondolinius and Marricopra had a full-fledged outbreak on their hands. Gondolinius gave Marricopra a half-hearted apology and then returned to declare war on the Northern Order.

But there were only 12 in the Order, and Gondolinius was still angry and so turned on itself and the Southern Order allies in Marricopra.

So began the Fire Wars, with the Southern Order lighting anything aflame that stood in their path. At one point, they appeared to be gaining the upper hand, but then half of them came down with the newest Lacertiliitis-fireplague mutation.

Though much of the world was vaccinated, the vaccine only worked on the 1895 strain, and those who had had Lizard Pox previously only had a 3-in-5 chance of recovery.

From Marricopra the new strain spread to Altar, then to Ashmanschkra. From Gondolinius it went to Gusmoas, Santa Marino, and then to Seseco.

Nowhere was safe anymore: the heat couldn't melt the diseased cells, and the cold couldn't kill them.

The Fire Wars became an absolute farce, with no real end to them after the Gondolinian Emperor died of the plague. The Order was considered once and for all extinct, though it was rumored that members were still strewn worldwide, lighting fires in secret. Altar was so crippled by the plague and war effort that they consented to being owned by Ashmanschkra for a time. However, the Ashmanschkran government finally collapsed, for once and for all, ruined by internal fighting and the overabundance of Greeg lizards.

Sevdrolet was finally overrun by the CoN, but then they all got sick. Sevdrolet had no official government after they all died of the plague, and the CoN retreated into itself, eventually being renamed the HPN. The Odorslatian governments survived; however, both were severely weakened and broke out into a few civil wars that all ended in painful deaths for all parties involved.

Gusmoas continued to have no contact with the outside world, becoming increasingly more superstitious and oddly religious, founding the Church of the Party People in the Trees. The Basilica of the Treehouse was built on the ruins of the Palace of Tressene. The mountain people built a massive temple to their founders, which is actually quite beautiful - adorned with intricate carvings, reflecting pools, and floating candles, etc - that still stands today. They call it the First Wonder of the Modern World, and honestly, who can dispute that?

Seseco had... problems (see: South Seseco). Oralotzo was almost completely wiped out, but a few thousand survived. They decided to work on re-fertilizing their soil, and only had contact with Skelmrelm.

And the Kingdom of Marricopra, ruled by King Bantramus II, finally collapsed.

With that ended the world's Second Age, and in 1920, Skelmrelm declared that the Second Apocalypse was over.

So began the Third Age.</pre>
